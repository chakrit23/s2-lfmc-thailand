s2-lfmc-thailand: Sentinel-2–Based Heuristic Framework for Near-Real-Time Live Fuel Moisture Content Mapping in Northern Thailand
s2-lfmc-thailand provides an open, reproducible implementation of a Sentinel-2–based workflow for estimating relative vegetation moisture conditions (Live Fuel Moisture Content, LFMC) across northern Thailand. The workflow follows the methodology described in the manuscript:

Chotamonsak et al. (2025). “Towards Near Real-Time Estimation of Live Fuel Moisture Content from Sentinel-2 for Fire Management in Northern Thailand.”

This repository includes the full Python code used for preprocessing, spectral-index computation, normalization, moisture proxy integration, and heuristic LFMC estimation. It is intended to support transparency, reproducibility, and future development of a validated LFMC monitoring system for fire management applications in mainland Southeast Asia.
